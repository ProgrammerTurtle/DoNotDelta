This is my journal of the design and building process of the DoNotDelta. 


### 5/21/2025 - 4 hours spent
Today was the beginning of design. First things first, I made the bottom base, with the printed frame, bottom panel, and motor assemblies (pulleys, bearings). ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b97b8d0-0c39-402f-a339-ae0fe06e48a3)
The bottom bases consist of an ABS print and a carbon fiber panel. These carbon fiber panels may end up being printed, depending on the cost for manufacture. I also designed the double shear modules to slide into the main base and then be bolted in. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ff311aa-fe11-45fc-a861-29fc10288f12) ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d65cb17-80e9-425a-a386-89898113a541) 
Double shear is in essence supporting the end of the motor shaft with a bearing. This puts the shaft in two shear planes rather than one. This means that when I properly tension the belts it won't do any harm to the motor shafts or motor bearings. 

Then, I mirrored that vertically and added in 10mm linear rods. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/42f2b44b-d235-4189-ae56-6d2460be4059) I chose 10mm linear rods rather than your typical 6 or 8 as the linear rods are structurally important. They do not add much to the price. 
After that, I decided to add electronics mounting/frame stabilization via din rails. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2efdec88-a63b-479d-b94a-403c42209909) These are a very useful electronics mounting standard, and will also add rigidity to the printer. 
The frame is now completed. 

I quickly moved on to designing the carriages. They needed to house linear bearings, a belt tensioning method, and mounting for the effector arms. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b39f4c5a-67f4-476b-ae00-bd9615a8eb57) ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f05552bb-06b1-4de5-8174-929307d2bf4d)
The blue square pictured is the belt tensioning setup, which clamps onto the belt using a wedge system and then is tightened via a screw on top. These are designed so that the belt will snap before the tensioner comes loose. 
I copied that 6 times, and the carriages were now figured out. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edc7b14b-4236-459a-9cc6-e972ed915bac)
Lastly for this session, I calculated an estimate for the delta arm lengths and modeled those in. I used the equations found here: https://reprap.org/wiki/Delta_geometry#Schematics

All that is left is the two effectors (think: toolhead and bed), the belt idlers, and finishing touches (like screws and electronics). ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9355e801-524a-46f6-9dcc-685c8a8ce343)
